Pyber Data Analysis

Here are 3 observations from the pyber data:

Greatest driver count and number of rides occurs in the Urban zone as expected. 

Average Fare is lowest in the Urban zone. How can we rise the average fare per ride? Carpool? Express Service?

Rural zone is the lowest in rides, drivers, and total fares. Is this area underserved? How can we provide more availability 
to the Rural and Suburban zones?
